# 👋 Hello, I'm Nhan Le Quy

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm an AI Engineer with a passion for developing intelligent systems and streamlining machine learning operations. My work bridges the gap between complex AI models and scalable, reliable deployment pipelines. I thrive on transforming innovative ideas into practical, real-world applications.

## 🛠️ Skills

- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python.
- **Web Development:** HTML, CSS, React, TailwingCss, Node.js
- **Databases:** MsSQLSever, MongoDB
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Docker, Visual Studio Code, Pycharm

## 📌 Featured Projects

- [**MLops**](https://github.com/NahwngLe/mlflow-network-anomaly-cicids2017.git): Network Anomaly Detection with Python & MLflow on CICIDS2017
This project applies machine learning to detect anomalies in network traffic using the CICIDS2017 dataset. MLflow is used to manage the model lifecycle, from experiment tracking to deployment, enabling reproducible and scalable MLOps workflows.

- [**Zebra Crossing Detection**](https://github.com/NahwngLe/ZebraCrossing_Detection.git): A deep learning-based computer vision project to detect zebra crossings in images using a custom-trained object detection model. The model is trained using Resnet50 and fine-tuned on a curated dataset to enhance real-world performance in urban and smart city environments.

- [**Prometheus & Grafana Monitoring Stack**](https://github.com/NahwngLe/prometheus-grafana): A ready-to-use monitoring stack that integrates Prometheus and Grafana via Docker Compose. This setup allows you to collect, store, and visualize metrics from your applications or infrastructure efficiently.

- [**Explainable AI seminar**](https://github.com/NahwngLe/XAI-in-CV): This project uses Streamlit, TensorFlow, and various visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM and Saliency to classify images and visualize the model's decision-making process. The app leverages MobileNetV2 for image classification.
